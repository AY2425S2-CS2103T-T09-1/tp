# INcontact
**INcontact is a desktop application for startup founders to keep track of business relationships.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).


* If you are interested in using INcontact, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](https://ay2425s2-cs2103t-t09-1.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing INcontact, the [**Developer Guide**](https://ay2425s2-cs2103t-t09-1.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
