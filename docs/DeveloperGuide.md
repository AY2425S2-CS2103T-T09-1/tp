## Design

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="281"  alt="Architecture Diagram"/>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="544"  alt="Architecture Sequence Diagram"/>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="314"  alt="Logic Component"/>

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* displays `Person` objects, including their associated `Relationship`s and `Tag`s, using the `PersonCard` within the `PersonListPanel`.
* displays `Event` objects using the `EventCard` within the `EventListPanel` (if implemented).
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="534" alt="Logic Class Diagram"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`, `AddRelationshipCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`, `AddRelationshipCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person, add a relationship, add an event).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600" alt="Parser Classes"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `AddRelationshipCommandParser`, `AddEventCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`, `AddRelationshipCommand`, `AddEventCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

#### Parser utilities

* `ParserUtil`: Provides utility methods for parsing common fields like `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Tag`, `Index`, and now also `EventName` and `Contact` (as a `Person`).
* `DateParserUtil`: Uses the Hawking library to provide natural language date parsing capabilities (e.g., "tomorrow", "next Monday", "2025-03-15"). This is used by event-related command parsers.
* `CliSyntax`: Defines the prefixes (e.g., `n/`, `p/`, `u/`, `fn/`, `en/`, `d/`) used in the command line interface.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (in `UniquePersonList`), `Relationship` objects (in `UniqueRelationshipList`), and `Event` objects (in an `ObservableList`). All these are encapsulated within the `AddressBook` object.
* stores the currently 'selected' objects (e.g., results of a search query) as separate _filtered_ lists (`FilteredList<Person>`, `FilteredList<Relationship>`, `FilteredList<Event>`) which are exposed to outsiders as unmodifiable `ObservableList`s that can be 'observed'.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

**Key Data Structures:**

*   **`Person`**: Represents a contact with fields like `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Address`, `Social`, `Tag`s, and a unique `id`.
*   **`Relationship`**: Represents a directed connection between two `Person`s identified by their unique IDs. It has a `forwardName` (e.g., "Boss of"), a `reverseName` (e.g., "Reports to"), and can have `Tag`s (e.g., "Work"). See the [Relationship Feature](#relationship-feature-linking-contacts) section for details.
*   **`Event`**: Represents an event with a `name`, `date` (LocalDateTime), `location`, `description`, `Tag`s, and a list of associated `Person` contacts (`UniquePersonList`). See the [Event Feature](#event-feature-managing-events) section for details.
*   **`UniquePersonList`**: Enforces uniqueness among `Person` objects based on `isSamePerson`.
*   **`UniqueRelationshipList`**: Enforces uniqueness among `Relationship` objects based on `isSameRelationship`.

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save `AddressBook` data (including `Person`s, `Relationship`s, and `Event`s) and `UserPref` data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* uses Jackson-friendly intermediate classes like `JsonAdaptedPerson`, `JsonAdaptedRelationship`, and `JsonAdaptedEvent` to handle the serialization and deserialization process.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component.
* `JsonAdaptedEvent` uses `DateParserUtil` from the Logic component's parser utilities to ensure consistent date handling between user input and stored data. While this increases coupling slightly, it maintains backward compatibility and ensures data integrity.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package. Examples include logging (`LogsCenter`), core utilities (`Config`, `GuiSettings`, `Version`), exceptions (`DataLoadingException`), and utility classes (`AppUtil`, `StringUtil`, `CollectionUtil`).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Relationship Feature: Linking Contacts

The Relationship feature allows users to define connections between contacts.

**Core Components:**

*   **`Relationship` Class:** Stores the core data:
    *   `firstUserId`, `secondUserId`: The unique IDs (`Person::getId`) of the two contacts involved. Using IDs makes the relationship robust against changes in contact details like name or phone.
    *   `forwardName`: The description of the relationship from the perspective of `firstUserId` (e.g., "Parent of").
    *   `reverseName`: The description from the perspective of `secondUserId` (e.g., "Child of"). This allows for asymmetric relationships.
    *   `tags`: A `Set<Tag>` for categorizing the relationship (e.g., "Work", "Family").
*   **`UniqueRelationshipList`:** Manages the collection of `Relationship` objects within the `AddressBook`. It ensures that duplicate relationships (based on the pair of users and the specific forward/reverse names) are not added.
*   **Relationship Commands:** (`addRelationship`, `deleteRelationship`, `addRelationshipTag`, `deleteRelationshipTag`, `findRelationship`) Provide the user interface for interacting with relationships.
*   **Relationship Parsers:** Parse the user input for relationship commands, handling prefixes like `u/` (userId), `fn/` (forward name), `rn/` (reverse name), and `t/` (tag).
*   **UI Display (`PersonCard`)**: Each `PersonCard` in the list displays the relationships relevant to that person. It fetches the relationships involving the person's ID from the `Model` and displays the appropriate relationship name (`forwardName` or `reverseName`) along with the *name* of the other person involved. To get the other person's name, it looks up the other person in the `AddressBook` using their ID.

**Implementation Details:**

*   **Identification:** Relationships are primarily identified by the unique IDs of the two persons involved. When deleting or modifying tags, the user provides both IDs and *one* of the relationship names (either forward or reverse). The system checks against both possibilities (`forwardName` and `reverseName`) to find the correct relationship. See `Relationship::isSameRelationship(String, String, String)`.
*   **Uniqueness:** `UniqueRelationshipList` prevents adding a relationship if another relationship with the exact same pair of IDs and same forward/reverse names already exists (considering both directions).
*   **Display Logic:** The `PersonListPanel` listens for changes in the `ObservableList<Relationship>` from the `Model`. When relationships are added, deleted, or updated (e.g., tags changed), it identifies the `Person` objects involved and triggers a refresh of the `ListView` or specific `PersonCard`s to reflect the changes.

*   <img src="images/UniqueRelationshipListClassDiagram.png" alt="UniqueRelationshipListClassDiagram"/>
*   <img src="images/JsonAdaptedRelationshipClassDiagram.png" alt="JsonAdaptedRelationshipClassDiagram"/>

**Design Considerations:**

*   **Alternative 1: Using Person objects directly:** Storing direct references to `Person` objects in `Relationship` would create strong coupling and potential issues if a `Person` object is deleted or modified in ways that affect equality.
    *   *Pros:* Simpler lookup of person details.
    *   *Cons:* Less robust, harder to manage lifecycle, potential memory leaks if references aren't cleared properly.
*   **Alternative 2 (Current Choice): Using Person IDs:** Storing unique, immutable `Person` IDs.
    *   *Pros:* Decouples `Relationship` from `Person` object instances, robust against `Person` updates, easier serialization.
    *   *Cons:* Requires looking up `Person` details (like name) from the `AddressBook` or `Model` when displaying relationships.
*   **Relationship Name Storage:** Using separate `forwardName` and `reverseName` allows representing asymmetric relationships clearly. An alternative could be a single name and a direction flag, but the current approach is arguably more descriptive.

### Event Feature: Managing Events

The Event feature allows users to schedule and manage events, associating contacts with them.

**Core Components:**

*   **`Event` Class:** Stores the event details:
    *   `id`: A unique identifier automatically generated for each event.
    *   `name`: The name of the event.
    *   `date`: The date and time of the event (`LocalDateTime`).
    *   `location`: The physical location of the event (optional).
    *   `description`: A description of the event (optional).
    *   `tags`: A `Set<Tag>` for categorizing the event (e.g., "Meeting", "Conference").
    *   `contacts`: A `UniquePersonList` containing the `Person` objects associated with this event.
*   **`AddressBook`:** Stores the list of all `Event` objects (currently as a simple `ObservableList`).
*   **Event Commands:** (`addEvent`, `deleteEvent`, `addEventContact`, `deleteEventContact`, `addEventTag`, `deleteEventTag`, `updateEventDate`, `updateEventDesc`, `updateEventLoc`) Provide the user interface for managing events.
*   **Event Parsers:** Parse user input for event commands, utilizing `DateParserUtil` for flexible date input.
*   **UI Display (`EventCard`, `EventListPanel`):** (If implemented) Display event information. `EventCard` shows details of a single event. `EventListPanel` shows the list of events.

**Implementation Details:**

*   **Date Handling:** `DateParserUtil` uses the Hawking library to parse natural language dates provided by the user (e.g., "next Friday at 2pm", "2025-04-10 10:00"). The parsed date is stored as a standard `LocalDateTime`.
*   **Contact Association:** Events store references to actual `Person` objects within their internal `UniquePersonList`. When an event is added using `addEvent`, the command parser creates *temporary* `Person` objects based on the names provided (`c/Contact Name`). The `AddEventCommand` then adds the event to the model and iterates through these temporary contacts. For each contact, it adds them to the *event's* contact list and also ensures the contact exists in the main `AddressBook` person list (adding them if necessary with default details). This ensures consistency.
*   **Modification:** Event properties (date, description, location) and associated data (tags, contacts) are modified using specific commands. Adding/removing tags or contacts, or updating properties, typically involves creating a *new* `Event` object with the changes and replacing the old one in the `Model` using `Model::updateEvent`.

**Sequence Diagrams:**

*   **Adding an Event:**
    <img src="images/AddEventCommandDiagram.png" alt="AddEventCommandDiagram"/>
*   **Updating Event Description:**
    <img src="images/UpdateEventDescriptionCommandDiagram.png" alt="UpdateEventDescriptionCommandDiagram"/>
*   **Updating Event Location:**
    <img src="images/UpdateEventLocation.png" alt="UpdateEventLocation"/>
*   **Updating Event Date:**
    <img src="images/UpdateEventDate.png" alt="UpdateEventDate"/>
*   **Adding a Tag to an Event:**
    <img src="images/AddTagToEventDiagram.png" alt="AddTagToEventDiagram"/>
*   **Deleting a Tag from an Event:**
    <img src="images/DeleteTagFromEvent.png" alt="DeleteTagFromEvent"/>
*   **Adding a Contact to an Event:**
    <img src="images/AddContactToEvent.png" alt="AddContactToEvent"/>
*   **Deleting a Contact from an Event:**
    <img src="images/DeleteContactFromEvent.png" alt="DeleteContactFromEvent"/>
*   **Deleting an Event:**
    <img src="images/DeleteEventCommandDiagram.png" alt="DeleteEventCommandDiagram"/>

**Design Considerations:**

*   **Event Storage:** Currently uses a standard `ObservableList` in `AddressBook`. A `UniqueEventList` could be implemented if strict uniqueness based on certain criteria (e.g., name and date) is required, though generating a unique ID simplifies this.
*   **Contact Management:** Storing `Person` references directly in the event's list simplifies access to contact details but requires careful handling, especially during deletion (ensuring contacts are not deleted from the main list just because they are removed from an event, and handling cases where a contact associated with an event is deleted from the main list). The current implementation adds contacts to the main list if they don't exist, which is one approach to manage this.

### Find Commands with Substring Matching

The `findName`, `findEmail`, `findPhone`, `findAddress`, `findSocial`, `findTag`, and `findRelationship` commands have been implemented to use case-insensitive *substring* matching instead of full word matching.

*   **Mechanism:** Each `findXYZ` command uses a corresponding `XYZContainsKeywordsAsSubstringPredicate` (e.g., `NameContainsKeywordsAsSubstringPredicate`).
*   **Predicate Logic:** Inside the `test` method of each predicate, it streams through the user-provided keywords. For each keyword, it checks if the relevant field in the `Person` object (e.g., `person.getName().fullName`) contains the keyword as a substring, ignoring case (`toLowerCase().contains(keyword.toLowerCase())`). The predicate returns `true` if *any* keyword matches as a substring within the field.
*   **Example (`findName`):** If a person's name is "Alex Yeoh", `findName Alex` will match, `findName Yeoh` will match, and `findName lex` will also match.
*   **Rationale:** Substring matching provides more flexibility for users who may not remember the exact full name, email, etc., allowing for partial matches.

**Sequence Diagram Example (`findName`):**

<img src="images/FindNameSequenceDiagram.png" alt="FindNameSequenceDiagram"/>

*(Similar diagrams exist for other find commands like `findEmail`, `findPhone`, etc.)*

### Sort Command

The `sort` command allows sorting the displayed person list based on one or more fields (`name`, `phone`, `email`, `address`, `tags`, `socials`). Field names are case-insensitive, so both `sort name` and `sort Name` will work the same way.

*   **Mechanism:** The `SortCommandParser` parses the field names and an optional `-r` flag for reverse order. The `SortCommand` then creates a `Comparator<Person>` based on the specified fields.
*   **Comparator Creation:** It starts with a comparator for the first field. For subsequent fields, it uses `thenComparing` to chain the sorting criteria. String fields (`name`, `phone`, `email`, `address`) use case-insensitive comparison. Collection fields (`tags`, `socials`) are compared using their string representation (HashSet's `toString()` method), which means sorting is based on the lexicographical comparison of their string values rather than individual elements or properties of the sets.
*   **Execution:** The `SortCommand` calls `Model.updateSortedPersonList(comparator)`, which in turn calls `AddressBook.sortPersons(comparator)`. This sorts the underlying `UniquePersonList` within the `AddressBook`. Since the `FilteredList` in `ModelManager` wraps the `ObservableList` from `AddressBook`, changes in the source list's order are reflected in the filtered/sorted list displayed in the UI.

**Sequence Diagram:**

<img src="images/SortSequenceDiagram.png" alt="SortSequenceDiagram"/>

### Redo Command and Redo List Command

The `redo` and `redoList` commands allow users to re-execute or view recently executed commands.

*   **`CommandHistory` Class:** A static class (`seedu.address.model.commandhistory.CommandHistory`) maintains a `Deque<String>` (double-ended queue) called `lastCommands`. This history is session-based and does not persist between program executions; it is initialized as empty when the application starts and cleared when the application is terminated.
*   **Adding Commands:** After a command is successfully parsed and *before* it's executed by `LogicManager`, the original command string is added to the front of the `lastCommands` deque using `CommandHistory.addCommandToHistory(userInput)`. If the deque size exceeds 10, the oldest command (at the end) is removed. Commands like `redo` itself are not added to the history to prevent recursive loops.
*   **`redoList` Command:** This command retrieves all commands from the `CommandHistory` deque and formats them into a numbered list for display to the user (currently thrown as a `CommandException` for display). The list only shows successfully executed commands from the current session, up to a maximum of 10 commands.
*   **`redo N` Command:**
    1.  Parses the integer `N`.
    2.  Validates `N` (must be between 1 and 10).
    3.  Retrieves the Nth command string from the `CommandHistory` using `CommandHistory.getCommandFromHistory(N)`.
    4.  Creates a *new* `AddressBookParser` instance.
    5.  Calls `parseCommand` on the retrieved command string.
    6.  Executes the resulting `Command` object. The result of *this* execution is returned to the user.

Sequence Diagram for Redo List Command:
<img src="images/RedoListSequenceDiagram.png" alt="RedoListSequenceDiagram"/>

**Design Considerations:**

*   **Storage:** History is stored in-memory and is lost when the application closes. Persisting history could be a future enhancement.
*   **Re-parsing vs. Storing Command Objects:** The current approach stores command *strings* and re-parses them.
    *   *Pros:* Simpler to store, avoids potential issues with storing complex command object states.
    *   *Cons:* Relies on the parser being deterministic and available. Minor overhead of re-parsing.
    *   *Alternative:* Store executed `Command` objects directly. Requires commands to be potentially serializable or easily reconstructible, might be more complex.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has the exact version of Java `17` installed according to the [Java Installation Guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallation.html).
1. Should be able to hold up to 1000 contacts, 1000 relationships, and 500 events without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
1. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
1. Data should be persisted between application sessions.

### Glossary

*   **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, macOS
*   **Relationship**: A directed connection between two contacts, having a forward name, a reverse name, and optional tags.
*   **Event**: A scheduled item with a name, date/time, optional location/description, tags, and associated contacts.
*   **ID**: A unique identifier automatically generated for each Person and Event. Used internally, but also shown to the user (e.g., for relationship commands).

## Appendix: Instructions for manual testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch 
   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder. 
   1. Double-click the jar file. Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. Relationships (if any sample data added) and Events (if any sample data added) might be displayed or accessible. The window size may not be optimum. Check for `config.json`, `preferences.json` and `data/addressbook.json` files created.
1. Saving window preferences
   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.
        Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Adding Relationships

1.  Add a valid relationship
    1.  Prerequisites: Have at least two contacts in the list. Note their IDs (shown in the contact card). Let IDs be `ID1` and `ID2`.
    1. Test case: `addRelationship u/ID1 u/ID2 fn/Mentor rn/Mentee t/Work`
        Expected: Success message is shown. The contact cards for persons with `ID1` and `ID2` should now display the relationship ("Mentor MenteeName" on ID1's card, "Mentee MentorName" on ID2's card) and the "Work" tag under the relationship.
1. Add a duplicate relationship
   1. Prerequisites: Relationship added in the previous step exists.
   1. Test case: `addRelationship u/ID1 u/ID2 fn/Mentor rn/Mentee`
        Expected: Error message "Relationship already exists." is shown. No changes in the UI.
   1. Test case: `addRelationship u/ID2 u/ID1 fn/Mentee rn/Mentor` (reversed roles)
        Expected: Error message "Relationship already exists." is shown. No changes in the UI.
1. Add relationship with non-existent ID
   1. Prerequisites: Get a valid ID `ID1`.
   1. Test case: `addRelationship u/ID1 u/NonExistentID fn/Friend rn/Friend`
        Expected: Error message "One or both contacts do not exist."
4.  Add relationship with self
    1.  Prerequisites: Get a valid ID `ID1`.
    2.  Test case: `addRelationship u/ID1 u/ID1 fn/Self rn/Self`
        Expected: Error message "A contact cannot have a relationship with itself."
5.  Add relationship with missing/empty names
    1.  Test case: `addRelationship u/ID1 u/ID2 fn/ rn/Mentee`
        Expected: Error message "Relationship name cannot be empty." or similar constraint violation.
    2.  Test case: `addRelationship u/ID1 u/ID2 fn/Mentor rn/`
        Expected: Error message "Relationship name cannot be empty." or similar constraint violation.

### Deleting Relationships

1.  Delete an existing relationship
    1.  Prerequisites: Add a relationship `addRelationship u/ID1 u/ID2 fn/Boss rn/Employee`.

        Expected: *If supported:* Persons ID1 and ID2 listed. *If not supported:* 0 persons listed or only matches relationship name. **(Note: The current `RelationshipContainsKeywordsAsSubstringPredicate` only checks if the person is *involved* in *any* relationship when the command is run, not if the relationship *itself* matches the keyword. This needs correction in the predicate or command logic to be useful.)**

### Sort Command

1.  Sort by single field
    1.  Prerequisites: List persons.
    2.  Test case: `sort name`
        Expected: Persons list is sorted alphabetically by name.

2.  Sort by multiple fields
    1.  Prerequisites: Add persons with the same name but different phone numbers.
    2.  Test case: `sort name phone`
        Expected: Persons list is sorted by name, and those with the same name are further sorted by phone number.
3.  Invalid sort field
    1.  Test case: `sort invalidField`
        Expected: Error message "Invalid field: invalidField".

### Redo and Redo List Commands

1.  List command history
    1.  Prerequisites: Execute several valid commands (e.g., `list`, `add n/Test`, `delete 1`).
    2.  Test case: `redoList`
        Expected: A numbered list of the recently executed commands (up to 10) is displayed in the result area (possibly as an error message, based on current implementation). `redo` commands themselves should not appear.
    **Note: redoList only keeps track of the command history of the last 10 commands, and this history will be cleared when the program is terminated.**
2.  Redo a command
    1.  Prerequisites: Execute `add n/RedoTestPerson`. Then execute `list`. The `add` command should be at index 2 in `redoList`.
    2.  Test case: `redo 2`
        Expected: The `add n/RedoTestPerson` command is executed again. An error "This person already exists..." should appear because the person was already added.
    3.  Test case: `delete 1`. Then `redo 1`.
        Expected: The `delete 1` command is executed again. If index 1 exists, it's deleted. If not, an "invalid index" error occurs for the *re-executed* delete.
3.  Invalid redo index
    1.  Test case: `redo 0`
        Expected: Error message "Invalid command index..."
    2.  Test case: `redo 11`
        Expected: Error message "Invalid command index..."
    3.  Test case: `redo 5` (when only 3 commands are in history)
        Expected: Error message "Not enough commands in history..."

### Saving data

1.  Dealing with missing/corrupted data files
    1.  Simulate missing file: Close the app. Delete the `data/addressbook.json` file. Relaunch the app.
        Expected: App starts with sample data (or an empty state if sample data loading is disabled after first run). A message indicating a new file is created might be logged.
    2.  Simulate corrupted file: Close the app. Open `data/addressbook.json` and replace its content with invalid JSON (e.g., "abcde"). Save the file. Relaunch the app.
        Expected: App starts with sample data or empty state. A warning about the corrupted file being loaded and replaced should appear in the logs or possibly as an error dialog.
2.  Verify data persistence
    1.  Add a person, a relationship, and an event.
    2.  Close the application.
    3.  Relaunch the application.
        Expected: The added person, relationship, and event are still present and correctly loaded. Check relationship display on person cards.
